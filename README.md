# Auto-Reboot-EC2-Instance-on-High-CPU-Load
This project automatically monitors an AWS EC2 instance's CPU utilization. When CPU usage crosses a defined threshold (e.g., 80%), it triggers a Lambda function that programmatically reboots the instance and sends an email notification via AWS SNS.

ðŸš€ Architecture
AWS EC2: Instance that is monitored.

AWS CloudWatch: Watches the CPUUtilization metric and triggers alarms.

AWS Lambda: Automatically reboots the instance when CPU is high and sends a notification.

AWS SNS (Simple Notification Service): Sends an email to alert that the instance was rebooted.

IAM Role: Provides Lambda with permissions to manage EC2 and publish to SNS.

ðŸ”¥ How It Works
CloudWatch Alarm monitors EC2 CPUUtilization.

When CPU > 80% (or a set threshold), CloudWatch triggers the Lambda function.

Lambda reboots the EC2 instance using reboot_instances() API.

Lambda then publishes a message to an SNS Topic notifying about the reboot action.

SNS sends an email alert to the subscribed user.

ðŸ“‚ Technologies Used
AWS EC2

AWS CloudWatch

AWS Lambda (Python 3.12)

AWS SNS

IAM Roles and Policies

ðŸ“œ Future Enhancements
Add condition in Lambda to check instance status before rebooting.

Reboot only specific EC2 tags (example: only reboot "production" servers).

Improve Lambda error handling and retries.

Integrate Slack/Webhook notifications instead of only email.

Add automatic scaling actions instead of just rebooting.

âœ¨ Learning Outcomes
Hands-on experience with AWS event-driven services.

Practical understanding of Lambda triggers and SNS integration.

Importance of auto-healing systems for Cloud Support roles (like AWS CSA).

How to monitor metrics and take actions without human intervention.

ðŸ“Œ This project is highly relevant for Cloud Support Associate (CSA) interviews and demonstrates automation, monitoring, and operational excellence using AWS.
